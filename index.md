  <h2 class="featurette-heading">USB Rubber Ducky<br><span class="muted">The Original Keystroke Injection Tool</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">Since 2010 the USB Rubber Ducky has been a favorite amongst hackers, penetration testers and IT professionals. With origins as a humble IT automation proof-of-concept using an embedded dev-board, it has grown into a full fledged commercial Keystroke Injection Attack Platform. The USB Rubber Ducky captured the imagination of hackers with its simple scripting language, formidable hardware, and covert design.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Quack <span class="muted">like a Keyboard!</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">Nearly every computer including desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones take input from Humans via Keyboards. It's why there's a specification with the ubiquitous USB standard known as HID - or Human Interface Device. Simply put, any USB device claiming to be a Keyboard HID will be automatically detected and accepted by most modern operating systems. Whether it be a Windows, Mac, Linux or Android device the <i>Keyboard is King</i>. 

    By taking advantage of this inherent trust with scripted keystrokes at speeds beyond 1000 words per minute traditional countermeasures can be bypassed by this tireless trooper - the USB Rubber Ducky.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Ducky Script. <span class="muted">Simply Simple.</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">
    USB Rubber Ducky's scripting language makes writing payloads simple. No programming experience needed.
  </p><ul><li>Typing "<i>Hello World</i>" is as simple as programming <i>STRING Hello World</i></li>
  <li>Add pauses in between commands with <i>DELAY</i>. Try <i>DELAY 100</i> for short 100 milliseconds pauses or <i>DELAY 1000</i> for longer 1 second pauses.</li>
  <li>Combine specials keys. <i>ALT F4, CONTROL ESCAPE, WINDOWS R, SHIFT TAB</i>. They all do exactly as you might expect.</li>
  <li>Comment your code! Use <i>REM</i> just as you would in any other language.</li>
  <li>That's it! You just learned Ducky Script.</li></ul>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Cross <span class="muted">Platform.</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Windows, Mac, Linux, Android - they all love keyboards. Convenience is king, so when it comes to plugging in a new input device the default is to accept and obey. 
    <br><br>Keyboards represent <b>human input</b> afterall. 
    <br><br>Before USB there were various standards, be it PS/2, AT, Apple Desktop Bus and various other DINs. Now that everything is Universal the Human Input Device is "Plug and Play".
